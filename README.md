# Blood Bank System

Introduction

Our project's main goal would be to develop an application that can be conveniently accessed by anyone to the National Blood Bank Network directly via their smartphones on a mobile application, or via a website to make it easier for both those in need of blood and donors. 

Manual system is very hard. We have to check each of the donor books of donors and mark them. But in this auto-mated system we computerized all details. It is easy for all Hospital staff and donors.

Problem & Solution

The existing National Blood Bank System only has a manual database management program in which they use QR codes to classify any donation made to the blood. However, awareness of blood donation services and even emergency needs is expected to spread as of right now only through social media and printed media sources. 

Our motivation for the project is to provide a platform for all people to quickly identify and notify them of the needs of the nearest accessible blood banks in case of emergency situations. The application will also keep track of the profile and medical records of each individual, in addition to it. 

We think it's easy for all instead of using donor cards and things. 

How it works
In this system there is an operator called admin in the Hospital Blood Bank unit. Only he/she can operate the admin account. He/she will be assigned by the hospital.

He/she can register donors for the system. In emergency situations he/she can contact donors and be encouraged to donate blood. They can search for the availability of blood paints.Not only that they also can search blood from the nearby Hospital when in an emergency situation.  

Donors register by admins. Donors have an account he/she can view his/her account and update details. If he/she wants the delete account, they can do it from the delete account section.

From this Web application and mobile application we encourage and motivate people to donate blood. We inform them how to donate blood and what are the benefits of it
